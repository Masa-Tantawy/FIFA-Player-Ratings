# FIFA-Player-Ratings
Football is one of the most popular and competitive sports worldwide. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association, known as FIFA, constantly analyzes each player’s performance and statistical attributes (such as strength, stamina, work rate on the field, etc.) and accordingly gives a rating to every player. However, some attributes have a heavier influence on a player’s overall rating than others. 
The aim of this project is to create a linear regression model to find whether or not all player attributes are significant or affect the overall rating that FIFA decides and predict the FIFA rating of a player given his/her attributes. The code was written in R.
